React + Firebase food diary with users

Styles:
index.css has app-wide basic styles like custom properties in :root
App.css has things for the Home(page).jsx and its components (signup and login forms...)
profile.css only has styles for the profile components
Other .css named after the related component directly (like profile.css is)

Function:
Two pages: Home and Profile, with their components...

config.js needs firebase key, etc. to get this started.
